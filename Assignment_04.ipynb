I will study their perfomance (time-complexity) using defined tridiagonal matrix. Note that time-complexity of Gauss-Seidell method closely depends on precision of the result. So, I have decided to measure time needed for Gauss-Seidel method to achief the relatively the same precision as Thomas alghoritm. In this way, both alghoritms will be in the same conditions and their comparison will make sense.\n",

This outcome cannot claim that on average Thomas alghoritms is faster than Gauss-Seidel (it is only one matrix studied). But asymptotic analysis has shown that Thomas alghoritm is faster."
